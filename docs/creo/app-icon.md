Every app needs a beautiful and memorable icon that attracts attention in the App Store and stands out on the Home screen. Your icon is the first opportunity to communicate, at a glance, your app’s purpose. It also appears throughout the system, such as in Settings and search results. You can manually provide each required image at each required resolution (12 images are required at the time of writing) or you can use the built-in icon generator to let Creo automatically creates all required icons for you. Please note that you should use your higher resolution image in this case.
