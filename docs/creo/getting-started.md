![Getting Started with Creo](creo_intro_1.png)

Welcome to the user manual for Creo. This documentation will help you become familiar with the powerful set of features available in Creo. Creo is an advanced macOS application that helps you create native mobile applications much faster than traditional tools. Creo combines the design phase and development phase processes in one highly-optimized and easy-to-use tool. 

### Minimum Requirements

To use the latest version of Creo you must be running OS X El Capitan (version 10.11) or higher. Creo is about 140MB in size so you wont't need gigabytes of free space.  It is small and efficient and runs perfectly on any machine from MacBook Air to Mac Pro.

### Downloading and registering Creo

If you havenâ€™t downloaded Creo yet, you can get the latest version from [https://creolabs.com/download](https://creolabs.com/download). You can use Creo for free with some limitations: no App Store deployment, no analytics and no code exporting. If you need to publish on the App Store or have access to all the features then you need to [purchase a plan](https://creolabs.com/store).

![Register Creo](creo_register.png)
