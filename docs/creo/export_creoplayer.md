Starting from Creo version 2.2, CreoPlayer is no longer available through TestFlight and it can be exported directly from within Creo. In this way we can guarantee to release the most up-to-date version the same day we release a new Creo build.

Once exported with your **Development Distribution** provisioning profile you can install it [on your device](https://docs.creolabs.com/creo/transfer-to-device.html). 

Select **Export CreoPlayer** from the **File** menu and the fill-in the Bundle ID and Provisioning Profile fields. Please note that you must use a Bundle ID that belongs to your certificate in order to be able to export a correct build.
