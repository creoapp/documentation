**super**: **[UIView](UIView.md)** (on iOS)

This class is reserved and cannot be directly instantiated.



### Events

* **DidScroll**()
This event is called when the user scrolls the content view.

* **DidEndDragging**(**decelerate**: **[Bool](../gravity/bool.md)**)
This event is called when dragging ended in the scroll view. The scroll view sends this event when the userâ€™s finger touches up after dragging content. The decelerating property of the scroll view controls deceleration. The decelerate value is true if the scrolling movement will continue, but decelerate, after a touch-up gesture during a dragging operation. If the value is NO, scrolling stops immediately upon touch-up.

* **DidEndDecelerating**()
This event is called when the scroll view ends decelerating the scrolling movement.



### Properties

* **var** **contentOffset**: **[Point](Point.md)**
The point at which the origin of the content view is offset from the origin of the scroll view.

* **var** **contentSize**: **[Size](Size.md)**
The size of the content view.

* **var** **contentInset**: **[EdgeInsets](EdgeInsets.md)**
The custom distance that the content view is inset from the safe area or scroll view edges.

* **var** **adjustedContentInset**: **[EdgeInsets](EdgeInsets.md)**
The insets derived from the content insets and the safe area of the scroll view. Available on iOS 11.0+. \(read-only\)

* **var** **contentInsetAdjustmentBehavior**: **[Int](../gravity/int.md)**
The behavior for determining the adjusted content offsets. Available on iOS 11.0+. <code>Automatic</code>: Similar to ScrollableAxes, but for backward compatibility (iOS < 11.0) will also adjust the top & bottom contentInset when the scroll view is owned by a view controller with automaticallyAdjustsScrollViewInsets = YES inside a navigation controller, regardless of whether the scroll view is scrollable. <code>ScrollableAxes</code>: Adjust the insets only in the scrollable directions. <code>Never</code>: Do not adjust the scroll view insets. <code>Always</code>: Always include the safe area insets in the content adjustment.

* **var** **bounces**: **[Bool](../gravity/bool.md)**
Boolean value that controls whether the scroll view bounces past the edge of content and back again. Bouncing visually indicates that scrolling has reached an edge of the content.

* **var** **alwaysBounceVertical**: **[Bool](../gravity/bool.md)**
A Boolean value that determines whether bouncing always occurs when vertical scrolling reaches the end of the content.

* **var** **alwaysBounceHorizontal**: **[Bool](../gravity/bool.md)**
A Boolean value that determines whether bouncing always occurs when horizontal scrolling reaches the end of the content view.

* **var** **pagingEnabled**: **[Bool](../gravity/bool.md)**
A Boolean value that determines whether paging is enabled for the scroll view.

* **var** **scrollEnabled**: **[Bool](../gravity/bool.md)**
A Boolean value that determines whether scrolling is enabled. When scrolling is disabled, the scroll view does not accept touch events; it forwards them up the responder chain.

* **var** **showsHorizontalScrollIndicator**: **[Bool](../gravity/bool.md)**
A Boolean value that controls whether the horizontal scroll indicator is visible. The indicator is visible while tracking is underway and fades out after tracking.

* **var** **showsVerticalScrollIndicator**: **[Bool](../gravity/bool.md)**
A Boolean value that controls whether the vertical scroll indicator is visible. The indicator is visible while tracking is underway and fades out after tracking.

* **var** **scrollIndicatorInsets**: **[EdgeInsets](EdgeInsets.md)**
The distance the scroll indicators are inset from the edge of the scroll view.

* **var** **indicatorStyle**: **<a href="#_enum_ScrollViewIndicatorStyle">ScrollViewIndicatorStyle</a>**
The style of the scroll indicators.

* **var** **decelerating**: **[Bool](../gravity/bool.md)**
Returns whether the content is moving in the scroll view after the user lifted their finger. \(read-only\)

* **var** **keyboardDismissMode**: **[Int](../gravity/int.md)**
The manner in which the keyboard is dismissed when a drag begins in the scroll view.

* **var** **objectName**: **[String](../gravity/string.md)**
The name of the object.



### Methods

* **func** **flashScrollIndicators**()
Displays the scroll indicators momentarily. You should call this method whenever you bring the scroll view to front.
