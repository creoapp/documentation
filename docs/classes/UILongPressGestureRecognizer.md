**super**: **[UIGestureRecognizer](UIGestureRecognizer.md)** (on iOS)

This class is reserved and cannot be directly instantiated.



### Events

* **Action**()
This event is called when the object recognizes its gesture or, in some cases, a change in the gesture.

* **ShouldRecognizeSimultaneously**(**otherGesture**: **[UIGestureRecognizer](UIGestureRecognizer.md)**): <strong>[Bool](../gravity/types.md)</strong> 
Asks if two gesture recognizers should be allowed to recognize gestures simultaneously. This event is called when recognition of a gesture by either this gesture recognizer or the other gesture recognizer passed as the parameter would block the other gesture recognizer from recognizing its gesture. Note that returning <i>true</i> is guaranteed to allow simultaneous recognition; returning <i>false</i>, on the other hand, is not guaranteed to prevent simultaneous recognition because the other gesture recognizer's event may return <i>true</i>. The default value is <i>false</i>.

* **ShouldBegin**(): <strong>[Bool](../gravity/types.md)</strong> 
Asks if a gesture recognizer should begin interpreting touches. This method is called when a gesture recognizer attempts to transition out of the GestureRecognizerState.Possible state. Returning <i>false</i> causes the gesture recognizer to transition to the GestureRecognizerState.Failed state. The default value is <i>true</i>.

* **ShouldReceiveTouch**(**touch**: **[UITouch](UITouch.md)**): <strong>[Bool](../gravity/types.md)</strong> 
Ask the delegate if a gesture recognizer should receive an object representing a touch. The default value is true.
