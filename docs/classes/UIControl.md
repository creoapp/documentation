**super**: **[UIView](UIView.md)** (on iOS)

This class is reserved and cannot be directly instantiated.





### Properties

* **var** **enabled**: **[Bool](../gravity/bool.md)**
A Boolean value indicating whether the control is enabled. An enabled control is capable of responding to user interactions, whereas a disabled control ignores touch events and may draw itself differently.

* **var** **highlighted**: **[Bool](../gravity/bool.md)**
A Boolean value indicating whether the control draws a highlight. Controls automatically set and clear this state in response to appropriate touch events. You can change the value of this property as needed to apply or remove a highlight programmatically.

* **var** **selected**: **[Bool](../gravity/bool.md)**
A Boolean value indicating whether the control is in the selected state. Most controls do not modify their appearance or behavior when selected, but some do.

* **var** **objectName**: **[String](../gravity/string.md)**
The name of the object.
